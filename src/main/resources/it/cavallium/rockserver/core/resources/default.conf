    # Setting unorderedWrite() to true trades higher write throughput
    # with relaxing the immutability guarantee of snapshots.
    # This violates the repeatability one expects from ::Get from a snapshot,
    # as well as ::MultiGet and Iterator's consistent-point-in-time view property.
    # If the application cannot tolerate the relaxed guarantees,
    # it can implement its own mechanisms to work around
    # that and yet benefit from the higher throughput.
    # Using TransactionDB with WRITE_PREPARED write policy and twoWriteQueues() true
    # is one way to achieve immutable snapshots despite unordered_write.
    # By default, i. e., when it is false, rocksdb does not advance the sequence
    # number for new snapshots unless all the writes with
    # lower sequence numbers are already finished.
    # This provides the immutability that we except from snapshots.
    # Moreover, since Iterator and MultiGet internally depend on snapshots,
    # the snapshot immutability results into Iterator
    # and MultiGet offering consistent-point-in-time view.
    # If set to true, although Read-Your-Own-Write property is still provided,
    # the snapshot immutability property is relaxed: the writes issued after
    # the snapshot is obtained (with larger sequence numbers) will be still not
    # visible to the reads from that snapshot, however, there still might be pending
